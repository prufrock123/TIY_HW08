/**
 * 15 things I learned from JavaScript-Garden:
 *
 * 1. - Weak typing is what causes the equality operator to coerce types into being comparable. I guess it allows you to 
 *      fudge values and lets JS sort it out.
 * 2. - Weak typing results in performance loss because the types have to be converted before being compared.
 * 3. - The strict equality operator compares for identify if one or both operands are an object. This means that any 
 *      primitives or empty objects will return false if compared to each other, as they are not the same object. 
 *      "hi" and "hi" are not the same object. var hi = "hi" is not the same as "hi". But hi === hi is true because the
 *      variables refer to the same object. 
 * 4. - The typeof operator is almost completely useless.
 * 5. - Prototype is the correct way to refer to things you might refer to as 'classes' in other languages like Ruby.
 *      It seems that things like Arrays and Strings are sub-prototypes of the Object prototype? Right?
 * 6. - typeof is really only useful to determine a variable is defined with something like the following typeof foo !== 'undefined'
 * 7. - The instanceof operator is mostly used to compare custom made objects.
 * 8. - You can set for instance Bar.prototype = Foo (Foo being a previously defined function object), but when you create a new Bar object
 *      this doesn't mean that Bar is an instance of Foo, but that Bar.prototype refers to another Foo. If Bar.prototype= new Foo();, then it would be true?
 * 9. - All JS is weakly typed so it will try to apply type coercion WHEREVER possible. Not just in the case of the non-strict equality operator (==).
 * 10.- Leaving of "new" when using Number constructor results in a kind of weak type comparison. Number(10) should be an object and !=== 10 (a primitive), but
 *      without the "new", the equality operator treats Number(10) not as an object, but as a primitive, resulting in a (false!) true.
 * 11.- You can cast to a string by prepending an empty string to a value.
 * 12.- You can cast to a number by prepending the unary plus operator to a value.
 * 13.- You can cast to a boolean by prepending a double not operator (!!) to a value.
 * 14.- You can use Object.prototype.toString to access the [[Class]] value of an object.
 * 15.- Passing int literals or non-object values into constructors can result in even more type coercion, so it is best
 *      to cast your literals and non-object values into the explicit type you intend to (string, number, boolean... possibly more?)
